## üß† Project Overview

We use a simple ML model (e.g., Iris Classifier or Sentiment Analyzer) and deploy it using **11 different methods**:

| # | Deployment Method           | Description |
|---|-----------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | FastAPI (Basic)             | Serve ML model using FastAPI |
| 2 | FastAPI Public API          | Expose the model as a public API |
| 3 | Heroku                      | Host FastAPI app on Heroku |
| 4 | Dockerized API              | Containerize the API for portable deployment |
| 5 | Azure App Service           | Deploy the app on Microsoft Azure |
| 6 | Streamlit App (Optional)   | Frontend UI for interacting with the model |
| 7 | AWS Lambda + API Gateway   | Serverless deployment using AWS |
| 8 | CI/CD (Heroku/Docker/Azure)| Automate testing & deployment |
| 9 | GitHub Actions              | CI/CD via GitHub Workflows |
|10 | Flask API                   | Serve the model using Flask |
